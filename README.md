# pfuncs #


### Description ###

A simple library that translates strings of mathematical expressions into
callable functions. Several common built-in functions are implemented.


### The PFunc Class ###
All parsing & interpreting is handled within the top-level `PFunc` class. It can
be initialized with a mathematical expression (as a string) [recommended], or 
with an Abstract Syntax Tree generated by the internal Parser.
	
If the underlying expession of a PFunc instance is univariate, then it can 
be called with and without keywords (provided the keyword matches the variable
in the expression). If the underlying expression is multivariate, then keywords
must be used. Additionally, if only a subset of the variables are provided, then
the PFunc is curried, and returns another PFunc instance as a function of the 
non-provided variables (see Example 3 below).


### Examples ###
1. Using the fixed point of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(x) = 1 %2B 1/x"> to approximate the Golden Ratio
```python
phi = pfuncs.PFunc('1/x + 1')
p = 1
for _ in range(30):
		p = phi(p)
print(p) 	# 1.6180339887496482
```

2. We can approximate Euler's constant _e_ using the first (historical) formula
```python
euler = pfuncs.PFunc('(1 + 1/n)**n')
print(euler(100))		# 2.704814
print(euler(n=5000)) 	# 2.718010
```
The convergence of this formula is obviously very slow, so `pfuncs` recognizes 'e' as a special constants in expressions:
```python
print(pfuncs.PFunc('e')) 	# 2.718281828459045
```

3. Expressions with an arbitrary number of variables can also be translated to a function, provided the values are provided as keyword arguments when the function is called. Here we calculate the total payment on a 30-year mortgage, compounded monthly:
```python
mortgage = pfuncs.PFunc('p*(1 + r/12)**(12 * 30)')
principal, rate = 180000, 2/100
print(mortgage(p=principal, r=rate)) 		# 327817.616263
rate = 4/100
fixed_rate = mortgage(r=rate)
print(type(fixed_rate)) 				  # <class 'pfuncs.callable.PFunc'>
print(fixed_rate(p=195000)) 			  # 646132.112848
print(fixed_rate(250000)) 				# 828374.5036517356
print(mortgage(p=195000, r=rate)) 		# 646132.112848
```


### Built-in Functions ###
The following functions are recognized as built-in functions by `pfuncs`:
* e^x, _exp( )_
* natural log, _log( )_ or _ln( )_
* log base 10, _log10( )_
* square root, _sqrt( )_
* absolute value, _abs( )_
* signum function, _sign( )_
* sine, _sin( )_
* cosine, _cos( )_
* tangent, _tan( )_
* arcsine, _arcsin( )_
* arccosine, _arccos( )_
* floor function, _floor( )_
* ceiling function, _ceil( )_
* integer function, _int( )_
* Gaussian error function, _erf( )_

Additionally, the following are recognized, but not implemented. I didn't really feel like parsing commas & optional parameters yet:
* minimum, _min(a, b, c, ...)_
* maximum, _max(a, b, c, ...)_
* normal cumulative distribution function, _normcdf(x, mu, sigma)_
* normal probability distribution function, _normcdf(x, mu, sigma)_


### Notes ###
* expressions are case-sensitive, so all built-in functions and constants (_e_ and _pi_ for now) need to be lowercase
* although not explicitly designed to handle numpy ndarray inputs, `pfuncs` accepts and evaluates them correctly as variable inputs. However, the Lexer and Parser are not designed to handle them as a term in the string expression


### Thanks ###
The parsing & interpreting framework are based almost solely on [Ruslan Spivak's wonderful _Let's Build a Simple Interpreter_](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) series of blog posts


### To-Do ###
* Implement the minumum, maximum, CDF, and PDF functions
* Allow for complex numbers. Went to all that trouble to implement _e_ - might as well make use of it
* (?) If a lexeme is tagged as an ID, search local namespace for that string & assume it's a function, thereby allowing for composition of functions
